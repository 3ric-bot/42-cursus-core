# Libft

This project is a comprehensive C library designed to implement standard functions found in the C standard library. The entire project,
including bonus features, is mandatory and fully integrated.

## Features:

  * Custom implementations of standard library functions (e.g., memcpy, strdup, strlen, etc.)
  * Enhanced functionalities through bonus components, including linked list management and additional utilities.
  * Thorough testing to ensure all functions operate as expected.

## Usage:
To compile and use the library, include the header file and link against the compiled libft.a.

Feel free to modify any part of the description to better fit your style or add any additional details!
